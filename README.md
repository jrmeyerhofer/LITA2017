# LITAForum 2017 - [Take your Google Apps to the next level with Google Apps Script][1]
Files, code, and other cool stuff from my LITA 2017 presentation: Take your Google Apps to the next level with Google Apps Script

**Description:** In this hands-on practical workshop, learn how to use Google Apps Script in some of your favorite Google Apps like Google Sheets, Forms, and Docs. We’ll start by learning how to create your own callable functions. Next, we’ll explore calling common APIs from within a Google Apps Script. Then, we’ll explore Web Scraping website content from within a Google Apps Script. Finally, we’ll develop a practical web application that combines the use of data, Google Sheets, Google Apps Script, a Javascript library, and a webpage to create a new book list you can take home and implement at your library.

Please have a Google account and if you have a laptop, please bring it.

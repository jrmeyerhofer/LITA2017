Many times during the session and while working with Google Apps Script, you will have to authorize your script to run. Google Apps Script requires user authorization to access private data from built-in Google services or advanced Google services.

Typically it looks like this:
You will get a general prompt to review permissions

If your script doesn't seem to be working and you haven't authorized, save or close and open your file to trigger the authorization process.

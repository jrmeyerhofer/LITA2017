# Lesson 1 - Getting Orientated

In this lesson we'll talk about what Google Apps Script (GAS) is, create our first script, and examine the development environment.

#### Google Apps Script:

Allows you to create add-ons for Google Sheets, Docs, Slides, or Forms, automate your workflow, integrate with external APIs, and more. It is JavaScript "like" and doesnâ€™t need to be compiled. Because it's built into Google, you don't have to worry about hosting, backups, security, patching your server/application, or uploading files to a server.

What can you do? Add a menu to a sheet, build a stand-alone application, or create a container bound application in a Google Sheet or Docs. You can also run a GAS application as a web service - independ from interfaces - that can be called from elsewhere on the web.

## Lesson Steps

1. Open Google Drive: https://drive.google.com
2. Create a new GAS file by clicking the New button -> More -> Google Apps Script
3. Note the Google Doc like environment
4. Name our file: "LITA 2017 Test script (Lesson One)"
5. Examine the File menu:<br/>
"See Version History" is where you can see all the coding changes after a save.<br/>
"Manage Versions..." allows you to create versions of your code for deployment.<br/>
"Project Properties" contains detailed Google information about your project. Good to know it's there.<br/>
6. Examine the Edit menu:<br/>
Triggers allow you to have the script run at a certain time or run based on an action - like when a Google Form is submitted.<br/>
7. Examine the Publish menu - we'll talk about this in a future lesson but just know that this is how you would deploy a web app.
8. Examine the Resources menu - mostly beyond scope of this session<br/>
"Advanced Google Services" where you can, and have to turn on, other Google services to interface with them.<br/>
9. Let's add the following code which will declare a variable and put something into the Logger (delete what's there):
```javascript
function myFunction() {
  // put something into the logger.
  var myTestVar = "John is cool";
  Logger.log("myTestVar is: " + myTestVar);
}
```
10. Save the project with the disk icon or File -> Save. *[Remember you may have to authorize your script](../authorize.md)*
11. Examine the Run menu - You can run just a single function which can help for testing, or debug a single function.<br/>
12. Run the function: myFunction()
13. Examine the View menu:<br/>
"Execution Transcript" shows you all the events and things that happened during the execution.<br/>
"Logs" is where you can see what was output with the Logger. This is a helpful way to debug or troubleshoot problems.<br/>
14. Place a stop point (red dot) and Debug the function: myFunction()<br /><br />

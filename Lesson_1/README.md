Lesson One - Getting orientated - demo coding environment - You can watch as I walk through this or walk along with me.

Basic file menu, just like google docs we can give our file a name.
We also have version control in GAS. We can create a new version. This is helpful for releases of code or just managing your code.

Code can be added in the code editor and follows the Javascript syntax
Add code to get the Project property.

function myFunction() {
  // put something into the logger.
  var myTestVar = "John is cool";
  Logger.log("myTestVar is: " + myTestVar);
}
//Logger Service: https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/base/logger

if we save, then run it then view the log. 
Talk about Run menu

Talk about Publish, Resoures, triggers later.

Javascript so doesnâ€™t need to be compiled. Show version control, 

What can you do? Add a menu to a sheet, stand-alone application, or container bound in a Google Sheet or Docs. Run as a web service - independ from interfaces.

Benefits - security built in, no patches to your own web server, no transfer files from computer to server, backups, version control,
